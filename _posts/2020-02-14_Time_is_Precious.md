Everyone has 24 hours or 1440 minutes or 84000 seconds a day
it depends on the individual how he invests/spends it
Both investing and spending has different meanings investing means you are using your time to make your future look bright. on the other hand, spending means we are using our precious time on something that helps
us only to make through our day. 
Everyone on this planet wants to be successful
Successful! What do you mean by success?
Different personalities have different views on success
like achieving  an aim is a success for someone, not for others

time is very powerful and we  shouldn't  waste it
sometimes we want some more time for some purpose
it is our own mistake because we don't know how to manage it effectively
in every situation with calmness and happiness.
we have to understand the meaning of managing time
so that we don't  waste time
As something  comes to my mind like
"Achievers think of seconds and minutes but losers think in hours and days"

Now, we have to talk according to category wise
I had divided the information into three  categories
 student life(generally from 12 to 21 age),
Professional life(generally from 22 to 40 age)
Senior phase (generally from 40 to 60 age)

A student's mind is full of creativeness and joy, they  think about their future 

In one's Professional lifetime cycle, one wants to make money, 
become successful and want to secure the future
of their child

Senior phase  is to help  other  people and motivate the students
to become successful in their lives.

At last, I want to convey again that time is very important in everyone's life. So, we  should use it in  an efficient manner
and consistently do things.
